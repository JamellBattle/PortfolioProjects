There are 2 separate projects here:
- DBFZ Character Usage Project
  
  This is a project I made in college. The "Random Generator Function", "DBFZ Character Generator", and "DBFZ Character Usage Portfolio Project" files are all a part of it.
  The goal of the project is to generate data on character usage in the video game "Dragonball FighterZ" and provide insights based on that data. Included in the data are things
  such as Player name, the platform the player play on, the region they're from, and of course the character they play, all randomly generated from pre-made tables. While not included
  here yet, I also used this data to create dashboards with SSRS.
  
- FGO Top Grossing Project
  
  This is a more recent project from late 2023 when I was exploring the Data Analyst field. The FGO Top Grossing Portfolio Project" is the only file for it.
  The point of this project was to look at the Top Grossing leaderboard placings of the mobile phone game "Fate/Grand Order" throughout 2021, and provide
  insights on its various placings using data from the game such as running events and new content releases. I also made a basic visualization
  using some of this data with Tableau, which can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jamell.battle/viz/FGOTopGrossing/Sheet1
